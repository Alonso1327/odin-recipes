    <p>Our favorite hotcakes made with buttermilk and wheat germ.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 quart buttermilk</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>½ cup wheat germ</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Mix in buttermilk, eggs, and melted
            butter. Stir wheat germ into the batter last.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly buttered griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and
            cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other
            side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
